## What Is a DoS Attack? {#dos-what-is}
A Denial of Service attack occurs when attackers attempt to stop a service from servicing the requests of legitimate users. Most commonly, this is done by flooding the service with requests until it is no longer able to respond as fast as the requests are coming in. By forcing the service to respond to the flood of requests continually, the service denies legitimate traffic.
