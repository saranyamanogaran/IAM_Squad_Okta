# DOS Mitigation Strategies {#dos}

Unfortunately, there's no way to *completely* prevent Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. And that's a problem because they're a plague upon our industry. Between [botnets consisting of 6 to 30 million bots](https://themerkle.com/top-4-largest-botnets-to-date), [30,000 distinct DoS attacks per year and growing](https://www.securityweek.com/internet-sees-nearly-30000-distinct-dos-attacks-each-day-study), and [11.2 billion connected "things" in use by the end of 2018](https://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3598917), this problem is only going to get worse. As a developer, the only thing you can do is attempt to mitigate the probability and effectiveness of an attack. So, how do you do that? First, you have to understand what a Denial of Service attack is.
