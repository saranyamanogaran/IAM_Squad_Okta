# Acknowledgments {#acknowledgments}

The authors of the book in your hands today (physically or digitally) would like to take a moment to thank a few individuals without whom this work would not have been assembled.

First and foremost, thanks to our editors, Okta's own Randall Degges and Keith Casey. Their tireless efforts have increased the quality of our work, while also ensuring its accuracy. Their guidance was invaluable and very much appreciated.

We would like to thank two additional Okta colleagues: Aaron Parecki, for graphic design and formatting of both the print and epub versions of this text; and Lindsay Brunner for project management, encouragement, and generally making all of us sound awesome.

And finally, our thanks to the rest of our Okta family, who supported this project from its inception. We hope you enjoy it!
